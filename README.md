What do you do when you can't produce a decent portfolio because a majority of your jobs require you to sign a NDA or your harddrive
crashed with your personal projects. You start over.  This is me starting over.  Parts of this site will be very professional and
other parts will be silly as I play and experiment with various technologies.    Ultimately elements on this site are here to show prospective
clients what I am capable of, to serve as backup, and to be a portal to my digital presence.  I am using a free no frills hosting service so load times may suffer.

Comments
----------------
This is where I explore the possibilities of showing or at least mixing 3D content with HTML5.  You should update your browser
because I am playing with a lot of current technologies and you will need a webgl enabled browser to get the full experience. 

 I am consistently modifying/adding code and time doesn't always permit me to push polished code at all times.  There are parts 
 that are slick and others that are not but I am getting there slowly but surely. 


Coming soon
--------------

The 3D section has been separated. It is now running as as Node.js application with the new Meteor Framework.  Very cool stuff.


Technologies
------------

[#cakephp](http://cakephp.org/) This is certainly my favorite PHP framework

[Processing.js](http://processingjs.org/) - Used for Jax Man

[Croogo](http://croogo.org) - If you are using CakePHP this was a pretty cool alternative to the Joomla Wordpress bandwagon
